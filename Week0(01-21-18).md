# Week 0

## Discussions

### [Naming changes to `Request`](https://github.com/vapor/vapor/issues/1443)
This week in discussion is the proposal to rename `Request` to `RequestContext` in order to differentiate between `HTTPRequest` and `Request` which in addition to an `HTTPRequest` (`req.http`) also contains `Container`s and an `EventLoop`.

### [Maximum Body Size](https://github.com/vapor/engine/issues/205)
This discussion is around the question of whether or not small request bodies should be treated differently than larger request bodies; specifically if small ones should be accessed synchronously. After a [pull request to support streaming bodies](https://github.com/vapor/vapor/pull/1435) the week before, all content access was required to be treated as asynchronous, but the changed also increased complexity of user code.

### [Case Sensitive Routing](https://github.com/vapor/vapor/issues/1196)
Should `/helloWorld` and `/helloworld` be sent to the same route? Should one throw `404`? Discuss!

## New Features

### [Fluent Cache](https://github.com/vapor/fluent/pull/358)
TODO: Put better example usage + some situations in which you might want to use Fluent Cache

### [PostgreSQL Support for JSON and JSONB](https://github.com/vapor/postgresql/issues/2#issuecomment-359335233)
TODO: Description

### [KeyedCache Sessions](https://github.com/vapor/vapor/pull/1444)
TODO: Description

### [PostgreSQL Support for Arrays](https://github.com/vapor/fluent-postgresql/pull/4)
PostgreSQL now has support for arrays. Arrays could be used in place of join tables in the case of simple values for a considerable perfomance boost!

### [Client Now Supports String URIs](https://github.com/vapor/vapor/pull/1446)
TODO: Better description
`req.make(Client.self).get("https://www.google.com")`

### [Vapor 3 Compiles With Swift 4](https://github.com/vapor/vapor/pull/1384)
Ready for the next update, whenever that will come.

## Under The Hood

### [Stream Refactor](https://github.com/vapor/async/pull/52)
TODO: Description

### [I honestly don't know what this one is](https://github.com/vapor/core/pull/86)
TODO: Everything

### [Eventloop and Future Optimizations](https://github.com/vapor/async/pull/57)

## Benchmarks

### [Vapor's engine nearly matches Go's FastHTTP](https://github.com/vapor/engine/pull/211#issuecomment-360758758)
Joannis benchmarked Vapor/Engine at 111324.52 requests/second and FastHTTP at 118479.28 requests/second. Nice! üèéüèéüèé

## Tutorials

### [Vapor 3 with Docker](https://bygri.github.io/2018/01/25/vapor-3-with-docker.html)
In this tutorial learn how to run Vapor 3 in Docker! Why? One of the best reasons right now is that Swift (and Vapor) often behaves differently on Linux than on macOS, so being able to locally test your code in a Linux container is much faster than pushing to Heroku every time you need to test something. 10 minute build times anyone?

### [How to Install Swift and Vapor on Ubuntu](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-swift-and-vapor-on-ubuntu-16-04)
In this guide, you'll install Swift and Vapor on Ubuntu 16.04. Then you'll test your setup by creating a simple web application using one of Vapor's templates.

## Built With Vapor
