# Week 0
The format is heavily inspired by [Swift Weekly (RIP)](https://swiftweekly.github.io/issue-98/) and [Swift Web Weekly](http://swiftwebweekly.com/) to a lesser extent.

## Discussions
Listing discussions will hopefully attract folks who are current heavy Vapor users or have a lot of server-side experience in general.

### [Naming changes to `Request`](https://github.com/vapor/vapor/issues/1443)
This week in discussion is the proposal to rename `Request` to `RequestContext` in order to differentiate between `HTTPRequest` and `Request` which in addition to an `HTTPRequest` (`req.http`) also contains `Container`s and an `EventLoop`.

### [Maximum Body Size](https://github.com/vapor/engine/issues/205)
This discussion is around the question of whether or not small request bodies should be treated differently than larger request bodies; specifically if small ones should be accessed synchronously. After a [pull request to support streaming bodies](https://github.com/vapor/vapor/pull/1435) the week before, all content access was required to be treated as asynchronous, but the changed also increased complexity of user code.

### [Case Sensitive Routing](https://github.com/vapor/vapor/issues/1196)
Should `/helloWorld` and `/helloworld` be sent to the same route? Should one throw `404`? Discuss!

## New Features
New features are listed after PRs are merged. New features are specifically user facing changes, and should come with a short description and a minimal code sample that displays usage. Small userfacing tweaks will not be listed.

### [Fluent Cache](https://github.com/vapor/fluent/pull/358)
#### Help Needed: Write better example usage + some situations in which you might want to use Fluent Cache

### [PostgreSQL Support for JSON and JSONB](https://github.com/vapor/postgresql/issues/2#issuecomment-359335233)
Using JSON/JSONB in a relational database might sound strange, but there are a [few situations where you might want functionality similar to a document store](https://www.citusdata.com/blog/2016/07/14/choosing-nosql-hstore-json-jsonb/).
#### Help Needed: Edit if you feel the above is inaccurate
#### Help Needed: Description of how you'd insert JSON/JSONB into a psql db. Do you have to do something with a `Content` `Model`?

### [KeyedCache Sessions](https://github.com/vapor/vapor/pull/1444)
#### Help Needed: Description of this feature. Should include an example usecase
#### Help Needed: Usage

### [PostgreSQL Support for Arrays](https://github.com/vapor/fluent-postgresql/pull/4)
PostgreSQL now has support for arrays. Arrays could be used in place of join tables in the case of simple values for a considerable performance boost!

### [Client Now Supports String URIs](https://github.com/vapor/vapor/pull/1446)
#### Help Needed: Description of this feature. What changed?
`req.make(Client.self).get("https://www.google.com")`

### [Vapor 3 Compiles With Swift 4.1](https://github.com/vapor/vapor/pull/1384)
XCode 9.3 is now in public beta and ships with Swift 4.1, which includes conditional conformance. Conditional conformance is sure to eliminate significant parts of the Vapor codebase. Yay! You can read more about the changes coming with Swift 4.1 [here](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## Under The Hood
Under the hood changes are things like refactors or optimizations that do not add any significant userfacing features. Everything in this section should come with a short description, but it can be as simple as "Optimizes X.

### [Stream Refactor](https://github.com/vapor/async/pull/52)
Simplifies Async streams. This has potential to simplify quite a bit of our async code.

### [I honestly don't know what this one is](https://github.com/vapor/core/pull/86)
#### Help Needed: Does this belong here? I don't know what this PR is at all.
#### Help Needed: Title, Description of improvements made

### [Eventloop and Future Optimizations](https://github.com/vapor/async/pull/57)
#### Help Needed: Description of improvements made

## Community Contributions
In this section I'd like to highlight some community PRs that got merged this week and inspire others to submit their first PR to Vapor. Proving that you don't have to know everything to write a small bugfix üòÄ

### [Fix parsing WebSocket close frame length](https://github.com/vapor/engine/pull/203)
Props to @tiwoc for their contribution! They fixed a websocket bug and ensured reliability in only 5 lines of code!

## Starter Tasks
This section consists of tasks that would be good for beginners to tackle. They do not necessarily have to be issues in the Vapor codebase itself, but they should contribute in some way to Vapor.

### [Swift Is Broken in Techempower's Framework Benchmarks](https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/issues/3181)
It would be awesome to for Vapor to compete in [TechEmpower's Framework Benchmarks](http://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/), however, their installation of Swift is both broken and a version behind. Their [instructions](https://frameworkbenchmarks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Codebase/Framework-Files/) will be helpful along with the Vapor/Swift on Unbuntu tutorial below. Drop into the #beta channel if you decide to give this issue a go and you have questions üòÄ¬†

## Benchmarks
This is where Vapor gets to flex a little üí™ It'll be nice to let readers track improvements and achievement.

### [Vapor's engine nearly matches Go's FastHTTP](https://github.com/vapor/engine/pull/211#issuecomment-360758758)
Joannis benchmarked Vapor/Engine at 111324.52 requests/second and FastHTTP at 118479.28 requests/second. Nice! üèéüèéüèé

## Tutorials
This is where any newly written tutorials pertaining to Vapor will be listed. I'm hoping doing so will give the content creators a little bump in traffic

### [Vapor 3 with Docker](https://bygri.github.io/2018/01/25/vapor-3-with-docker.html)
In this tutorial learn how to run Vapor 3 in Docker! Why? One of the best reasons right now is that Swift (and Vapor) often behaves differently on Linux than on macOS, so being able to locally test your code in a Linux container is much faster than pushing to Heroku every time you need to test something. 10 minute build times anyone?

### [How to Install Swift and Vapor on Ubuntu](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-swift-and-vapor-on-ubuntu-16-04)
In this guide, you'll install Swift and Vapor on Ubuntu 16.04. Then you'll test your setup by creating a simple web application using one of Vapor's templates.

## Built With Vapor
To showcase what people are doing with Vapor and to inspire others to create and share.

### [Leaderboard App](https://leaderboardapp.com)
Keep track of your office games.

## Micro Tutorial
I think it'd be fun to include a tiny tutorial at the end. Ideally it'd just be a code snippet that showcases some Vapor syntax that the devs are proud of along with a short description of what it does.

TODO: I'm thinking of doing the simplest possible Hello World implementation for the first micro tutorial
#### Help Needed: Code sample for simplest possible Hello World
