## Discussions

### [Naming changes to `Request`](https://github.com/vapor/vapor/issues/1443)
This week in discussion is the proposal to rename `Request` to `RequestContext` in order to differentiate between `HTTPRequest` and `Request` which in addition to an `HTTPRequest` (`req.http`) also contains `Container`s and an `EventLoop`.

### [Maximum Body Size](https://github.com/vapor/engine/issues/205)
This discussion is around the question of whether or not small request bodies should be treated differently than larger request bodies; specifically if small ones should be accessed synchronously. After a [pull request to support streaming bodies](https://github.com/vapor/vapor/pull/1435) the week before, all content access was required to be treated as asynchronous, but the changed also increased complexity of user code.
