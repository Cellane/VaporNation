### [Naming changes to `Request`](https://github.com/vapor/vapor/issues/1443)
This week in discussion is the proposal to rename `Request` to `RequestContext` in order to differentiate between `HTTPRequest` and `Request` which in addition to an `HTTPRequest` (`req.http`) also contains `Container`s and an `EventLoop`.
