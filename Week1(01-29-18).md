# Week 1

## New Features

### [CHTTP Refactor](https://github.com/vapor/vapor/pull/1458)
Performance was optimized for all HTTP requests. In addition convenience accessors like `req.headers` are now gone in favor of more explicit calls to `req.http.*`. So if you were using `req.headers`, that would now be `req.http.headers`. Calls to `print(...)` or `debugPrint(...)` passing in a `Request` or `Response`, now provide better information.

## Under The Hood

### [CHTTP Refactor](https://github.com/vapor/engine/pull/211)
Resulted in >20% increase in the number of requests Vapor's engine could handle per second
