# Week 1

Before we get into it, I'd like to give a shout out to [@0xTim](https://github.com/0xTim) for writing an [awesome article](https://geeks.brokenhands.io/blog/posts/whats-new-in-vapor-3/) on the high level changes between Vapor 2 and Vapor 3. If that sounds like your jam, give it a read! They'll be keeping it up to date all the way up to the official release of Vapor 3 so feel free to check back every once in a while.

## News

### [Vapor 3 Release Schedule Announced!](https://medium.com/@qutheory/vapor-3-release-schedule-1179bb080ca4)
We're looking at the first tagged Beta release on February 9th, the first stable release on February 23rd and Vapor 3.0 sometime in mid March to coincide with the Swift 4.1 release. In addition Vapor 3 relies on the [Swift 4.1 beta](https://swift.org/download/#snapshots) as of this week, so go get it installed!

## New Features

### [CHTTP Refactor](https://github.com/vapor/vapor/pull/1458)
Performance was optimized for all HTTP requests. In addition convenience accessors like `req.headers` are now gone in favor of more explicit calls to `req.http.*`. So if you were using `req.headers`, that would now be `req.http.headers`. Calls to `print(...)` or `debugPrint(...)` passing in a `Request` or `Response`, now provide better information.

## Under The Hood

### [CHTTP Refactor](https://github.com/vapor/engine/pull/211)
Resulted in >20% increase in the number of requests Vapor's engine could handle per second

### [SocketSink and SocketSource Refactor](https://github.com/vapor/sockets/pull/157)
Moved the TCP socket streaming classes out of the `Async` package and into `Sockets`, allowing necessary behaviorial divergence for TLS-enabled sockets. It's also conceptually cleaner to have the sockets-specific code in the `Sockets` package.

## Community Contributions
Community contributions is where we take the time to highlight community members who saw an issue and put in the work to fix it. Check out what these folks are doing, and maybe get yourself on this list next week! üòÄ

### [Changed query comparison operators paths to `KeyPath`](https://github.com/vapor/fluent/pull/360)
[@calebkleveter](https://github.com/calebkleveter) enabled Vapor users to compare constant, as well as variable model properties. (3 Lines of Code)

## Benchmarks

### Vapor Beats Go's Gin and Node's Express in Requests per Second
It's an unofficial benchmark run by Tanner, but here are the numbers!
- ~150k RPS Pure TCP echo server (hard ceiling)
- 140k RPS Go/FastHTTP (not a web framework)
- 131k RPS Swift/Vapor
- 99k RPS Go/Gin
- 60k RPS Node/Express

That's >91% efficiency we're seeing from Vapor! Nice! Huge gains were made via lazy header parsing. Since most of the time between 0 and 1 headers need to be accessed, header data is copied into a buffer and retrieved only when requested. Another big gain resulted from utilizing [Copy on Write wrappers](https://marcosantadev.com/copy-write-swift-value-types/) which let you fine tune when data actually gets copied. To quote Tanner

>Our `HTTPRequest` is a struct, but since the headers are in a CoW wrapper, the request can be copied and mutated as much as desired without copying the headers. The headers will only copy if they detect belonging to _two_ distinct HTTPRequests and one of them is trying to mutate their contents. If no one tries to mutate the headers, it's possible you could have hundreds of HTTP requests all sharing the same header storage in memory. This makes Swift really special because it's a case where being higher level than C can actually yield _more_ performance than is realistically possible in C.

That's pretty awesome if you ask me üèÅ

## Tutorials

### [Routing in Vapor 3, Part 1: Basic Routing](https://www.vaporforums.io/thread/34)
Routing is at the heart of web frameworks, and it's easy with Vapor. This tutorial will teach you what you need to know to get started.
