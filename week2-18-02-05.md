# Week 2

It's a big week for Vapor! With the finalization of tagged beta releases on February 9th, you can finally update without worrying (too much) about it breaking your project. In addition to everything in this week's Vapor Nation, there were loads of bug fixes and minor improvements behind the scenes, so if you were holding off because of a blocking bug before, now would be a good time to update your projects and give it another shot. Without further ado, let's get into it!

## Discussions

### `map` and `flatmap` Explicit Return Type
Should `map` and `flatmap` require an explicit return type when their input is the same type as their output?

[https://github.com/vapor/async/pull/51](https://github.com/vapor/async/pull/51)

### `catchMap` Naming and Behavior
Should there be a way to catch specific errors in promise chains? What should it be called?

[https://github.com/vapor/async/issues/65](https://github.com/vapor/async/issues/65)

## New Features

### Next Tick
Adds `eventLoop.onNextTick { ... }`, `promise.complete(..., onNextTick: ...)`, and `worker.doBlockingWork { ... }` which should prevent stack overflows in some cases.

## Under The Hood

### Add error handlers to TCP Sockets
#### HELP NEEDED: Not sure if this is important enough to be here or what it is

### Remove Max Response Size
#### HELP NEEDED: Unsure of the impact of this PR or if it belongs here
#### [Related? Was this resolved or rejected?](https://github.com/vapor/engine/issues/205)

## Community Contributions
### Massive overhaul of mismanaged memory in Engine
#### I'm leaving this one to gwynne 

[https://github.com/vapor/engine/pull/220](https://github.com/vapor/engine/pull/220)

### Add header names and use constants where possible
[@siemensikkema](https://github.com/siemensikkema) noticed a few missing HTTP headers so they added them in and increased safety by replacing string literals with constants where possible. (9 LoC)

[https://github.com/vapor/engine/pull/215](https://github.com/vapor/engine/pull/215)

### Code Cleanup
[@siemensikkema](https://github.com/siemensikkema) was busy this week! They went through and updating comments and removing blank lines where possible, generally improving the code cleanliness. (50 LoC)

[https://github.com/vapor/vapor/pull/1475](https://github.com/vapor/vapor/pull/1475)

### Teapot
**_Very_** important PR that adds a missing HTTP code. (1 LoC)

[https://github.com/vapor/engine/pull/219](https://github.com/vapor/engine/pull/219)

### Fixed Exclusive Access to Memory
Swift 4.1 introduced the requierment that [exclusive memory access be enforced on a per-line basis](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/MemorySafety.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH46-ID567). Most people felt this was over all, a good change, but there were a few places in the Vapor codebase that the rule wasn't being followed and it was preventing compliation. [@SandorDobi](https://github.com/SandorDobi) fixed that. (20 LoC)

## Made With Vapor

### serversideswift.racing
Vapor is about a week away from passing Perfect in the number of Github stars! While this isn't the most important metric, that would make Vapor the most popular server-side Swift framework on Github, and you can track the momentous occasion using [http://serversideswift.racing/](http://serversideswift.racing/) made by [@MartinLasek](https://github.com/MartinLasek)!
