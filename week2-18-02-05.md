# Week 2

It's a big week for Vapor! With the finalization of tagged beta releases on February 9th, you can finally update without worrying about breaking your project. In addition to everything in this week's Vapor Nation, there were loads of bug fixes and minor improvements behind the scenes, so if you were holding off because of a blocking bug before, now would be a good time to update your projects and give it another shot. Without further ado, let's get into it!

## Discussions

### `map` and `flatmap` Explicit Return Type
Should `map` and `flatmap` require an explicit return type when their input is the same type as their output?

[https://github.com/vapor/async/pull/51](https://github.com/vapor/async/pull/51)

### `catchMap` Naming and Behavior
Should there be a way to catch specific errors in promise chains? What should it be called?

## New Features

### Next Tick
Adds `eventLoop.onNextTick { ... }`, `promise.complete(..., onNextTick: ...)`, and `worker.doBlockingWork { ... }` which should prevent stack overflows in some cases.

### Add header names and use constants where possible
[@siemensikkema](https://github.com/siemensikkema) noticed a few missing HTTP headers so they added them in and increased safety by replacing string literals with constants where possible. (9 LoC)
