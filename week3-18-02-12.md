# Week 3

## New Features
### Helper Methods to Decode Content From Request Bodies
It's very common to need to take the body of a request and decode it to an object, so to cut down on boilerplate, a new methods were introduced to do that automatically on any HTTP method that accepted a body.

```
router.post(LoginRequest.self, at: "login") { req, loginRequest -> Response in
    print(loginRequest.email) // user@vapor.codes
    print(loginRequest.password) // don't look!
    return req.makeResponse()
}
```

### Case Insensitive Routing
You're now able to have routes be called, even if the case of the request isn't quite right, which means that

```
router.get("hello") { req in
// stuff
}
```

will still capture a request to `/Hello`

#### HELP NEEDED: Example of Case Insensitive Routing being enabled

### Fatal Error Cleanup
As Vapor gets closer to stability, fatal errors need to be removed so that servers aren't crashing in production. [@labradon](https://github.com/labradon) got the project well on its way by eliminating 29 fatal errors and replacing them with their proper thrown errors. (33 LoC)
