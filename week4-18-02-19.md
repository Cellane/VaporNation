# Week 4

## New Features

### Services Created With Value Types Are Always Singletons
#### HELP NEEDED: Unsure of the impact of this one.

[vapor/service#14](https://github.com/vapor/service/pull/14)

### Both `struct` and `class` SQLite Models No Longer Require `init` Methods To Be Defined
```
struct Foo: SQLiteModel {
    var id: Int?
    var name: String
}

final class Bar: SQLiteModel {
    var id: Int?
    var name: String
}
```

### Debuggable
#### HELP NEEDED: Write description

[vapor/core#92](https://github.com/vapor/core/pull/92)

### Allow Session To Be Passed In
#### HELP NEEDED: Write description

[vapor/engine#237](https://github.com/vapor/engine/pull/237)

### Client Redirection
#### HELP NEEDED: Write description

[vapor/vapor#1480](https://github.com/vapor/vapor/pull/1480)


## Under The Hood

### Lazy Middleware
#### HELP NEEDED: Write description

[vapor/vapor#1507](https://github.com/vapor/vapor/pull/1507)

## Help Wanted

### Leaf Syntax Highlighthing For Intelijay
Any new framework is nothing without good tools, and Vapor is no different. While Swift syntax highlighting is fairly easy to come by, Leaf is not.

## Community Contributions

### Fix an Xcode Crash In API Template
Anyone who's used Vapor knows that Xcode tends to experiece problems during Vapor development that you wont have seen if you've only used Xcode for iOS. For example, if an error is raised to the top level in iOS, it gets caught by `AppDelegate`, but Vapor apps don't have an `AppDelegate` equivilent, so instead errors raised to to the top level crash Xcode. That tends to trip up newer users, so in their joint PR, [@twof](https://github.com/twof) and [@0xTim](https://github.com/0xTim) fixed Vapor 3's API template to catch top level errors and prevent Xcode from crashing.

### MySQL Fixes To More Closely Conform To Client-Server Protocol
#### HELP NEEDED: Write Description

[vapor/mysql#127](https://github.com/vapor/mysql/pull/127)

### Dependency Updates
Same as last week. Tracking which dependencies need updates is hard!

### Updated RoutingGroups
#### HELP NEEDED: Title needs to better reflect what's new
#### HELP NEEDED: Better description of the feature

[vapor/vapor#1388](https://github.com/vapor/vapor/pull/1388)

### Use Cached Connection For Parameter Lookup
#### HELP NEEDED: Write description

[vapor/fluent#385](https://github.com/vapor/fluent/pull/385)

## Built For Vapor
This week we saw quite a few libraries spring up to ease Vapor 3 developement. It's super exciting to see people building off the basic types that Vapor provides, and I can't wait to see what else people come up with!

### Terse
Anyone who's done any asyncronous programming in the past 20 years knows all too much about callback hell. While Vapor 3 attempts to limit nested callbacks by encouraging the use of `Promise` chains, sometimes you just can't get around it. Terse, created by [@John-Connolly](https://github.com/John-Connolly) attempts to further alliviate callback hell by introducing functional programming inspired custom infix operators.

Syntax example:

```swift
func get(with client: RedisClient, for data: RedisData) -> Future<RedisData> {
        return client.command("GET", [data])
}

private func terse(_ req: Request) throws -> Future<RedisResponse> {
        let client = try req.make(RedisClient.self)
        return get(with: client, for: "KEY")
            >>-  curry(get)(client)
            >>-  curry(get)(client)
            >>-  curry(get)(client)
            <^> RedisResponse.init
}
```

### Awesome Vapor
Speaking of things built for Vapor, this next entry should make you happy if you ever needed to complete a task and wondered for a while whether there isn't an existing library that would help you reach your goal easier. Well, wonder no more as the Awesome Vapor document aims to compile everything awesome that works out of the box with Vapor. Besides libraries, the catalogue also contains useful resources for learning more about Vapor and lists well-done open-source projects that might inspire you.

As is the case with all existing “awesome-” listings for other software projects, Awesome Vapor focuses on quality of its entries, not quantity, so if you decide to follow the list's recommendation, you know you made the right choice.

### Vapor-Community Extensions
The community has been coming up with all sorts of useful extensions to core Vapor types, but not all of them belong in Vapor itself for one reason or another. For those, [@gperdomor](https://github.com/gperdomor) opened up extensions repos for a few packages. By adding these to your project, you'll get access to a slew of helper methods! If you're looking to contribute, these are a good oportunity.

## Microtutorial
Standard promise chains are perfectly fine if only one `Future` needs to complete before you can move onto the next step, but what if you need the results from two `Future`s? One of the problems run into here is that you often need to start embedding promise callbacks and all of a sudden you're back to callback hell.
