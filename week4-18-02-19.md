### Fix an Xcode Crash In API Template
Anyone who's used Vapor knows that Xcode tends to experiece problems during Vapor development that you wont have seen if you've only used Xcode for iOS. For example, if an error is raised to the top level in iOS, it gets caught by `AppDelegate`, but Vapor apps don't have an `AppDelegate` equivilent, so instead errors raised to to the top level crash Xcode. That tends to trip up newer users, so in their joint PR, [@twof](https://github.com/twof) and [@0xTim](https://github.com/0xTim) fixed Vapor 3's API template to catch top level errors and prevent Xcode from crashing.

## Built For Vapor
#### TODO: Write intro for this section explaining what it is because it's a new section for Vapor Nation

### Terse
Anyone who's done any asyncronous programming in the past 20 years knows all too much about callback hell. While Vapor 3 attempts to limit nested callbacks by encouraging the use of `Promise` chains, sometimes you just can't get around it. Terse, created by [@John-Connolly](https://github.com/John-Connolly) attempts to further alliviate callback hell by introducing functional programming inspired custom infix operators.

Syntax example:

```swift
func get(with client: RedisClient, for data: RedisData) -> Future<RedisData> {
        return client.command("GET", [data])
}

private func terse(_ req: Request) throws -> Future<RedisResponse> {
        let client = try req.make(RedisClient.self)
        return get(with: client, for: "KEY")
            >>-  curry(get)(client)
            >>-  curry(get)(client)
            >>-  curry(get)(client)
            <^> RedisResponse.init
}
```

## Microtutorial
#### HELP NEEDED: What will this week's microtutorial be? I'm thinking about how to combine Promises, but if someone else has a better idea, voice it in #vapor-nation
