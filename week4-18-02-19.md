# Week 4
## Built For Vapor
#### TODO: Write intro for this section explaining what it is because it's a new section for Vapor Nation

### Terse
Anyone who's done any asyncronous programming in the past 20 years knows all too much about callback hell. While Vapor 3 attempts to limit nested callbacks by encouraging the use of `Promise` chains, sometimes you just can't get around it. Terse, created by [@John-Connolly](https://github.com/John-Connolly) attempts to further alliviate callback hell by introducing functional programming inspired custom infix operators.

Syntax example:

```swift
func get(with client: RedisClient, for data: RedisData) -> Future<RedisData> {
        return client.command("GET", [data])
}

private func terse(_ req: Request) throws -> Future<RedisResponse> {
        let client = try req.make(RedisClient.self)
        return get(with: client, for: "KEY")
            >>-  curry(get)(client)
            >>-  curry(get)(client)
            >>-  curry(get)(client)
            <^> RedisResponse.init
}
```
